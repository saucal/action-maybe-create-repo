# Maybe Create Repo

This action ensures existence of a particular repo in GH. If it doesn't exist, it attempts to create it with the provided token.

## Limitations

* Requires organization to work. Doesn't currently support personal accounts.

## Getting Started

The following example will create a repo within the same organization with the built suffix. Eg, if this runs on `sample/repo`, a repo would be created under `sample/repo-built`

```yml
- name: Ensure Repo Exists
  id: repo-check
  uses: saucal/action-maybe-create-repo@v1
  with:
    token: "GH_PERSONAL_TOKEN" # need a token that can create repos in an organization
    repo-suffix: "built"
```

## Full options

```yml
- uses: saucal/action-maybe-create-repo@v1
  with:
    # Repo to use as a base
    repo: "${{ github.repository }}"

    # Token to use to create the repo. 
    # Defaults to autogenerated one but won't work due to permissions ðŸ¤ª
    token: "${{ github.token }}"

    # Suffix to use on newly generated repo (appended to the current repo name)
    repo-suffix: "built"
```

## Outputs

```yml
# Slug of the repo created
- ${{ steps.*.outputs.repo }}
```
